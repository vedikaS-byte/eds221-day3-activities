# Conditional statements
## Task 1
```{r}

# Create an object called pm2_5 with a value of 48 (representing Particulate Matter 2.5, an indicator for air quality, in 
pm2_5 <- 48

#  (see more about PM2.5 here).
# 
# Write an if - else if - else statement that returns “Low to moderate risk” if pm2_5 (for Particulate Matter 2.5) is less than 100, “Unhealthy for sensitive groups” if PM 2.5 is 100 <= pm2_5 < 150, and “Health risk present” if PM 2.5 is >= 150.
# 
if(pm2_5 < 100) {
  print("Low to moderate risk")
} else if(100 <= pm2_5 & pm2_5 < 150) {
  print("Unhealthy for sensitive groups")
} else(pm2_5 >= 150) 
  print("Health risk present") 

 
# Test by changing the value of your pm2_5 object and re-running your statement to check.


```
## Task 2 
```{r}
# Store the string “blue whale” as an object called species. Write an if statement that returns “You found a whale!” if the string “whale” is detected in species, otherwise return nothing. Test by changing the species string & re-running to see output.
species <- "blue whale"
?match()
switch (species,
  "blue whale" = print("You found a whale!"))

```

## Task 3
```{r}
# Store the base price of a burrito as base_burrito with a value of 6.50. Store main_ingredient with a starting string of “veggie.” 
base_burrito <- 6.50 
#main_ingredient <- "veggie"

#Write a statement that will return the price of a burrito based on what a user specifies as “main_ingredient” (either “veggie”, “chicken” or “steak”) given the following:

# A veggie burrito is the cost of a base burrito
# A chicken burrito costs 3.00 more than a base burrito
# A steak burrito costs 3.25 more than a base burrito
main_cost <- function(main_ingredient)
  { 
  if(main_ingredient == "veggie") {
  cost_burrito = base_burrito 
  print(cost_burrito)
} else if (main_ingredient == "chicken"){
  cost_burrito = 3 * base_burrito
  print(cost_burrito)
} else {
  cost_burrito = 3.25 * base_burrito
  print(cost_burrito)
}
}
main_cost("veggie")
main_cost("steak")
main_cost("chicken")
# you can also use switch()
```
# For loop
